# HostIn Project Log

This file tracks what was requested, what decisions were made, what changed, and what was verified during the project. Keep appending new work here as the product evolves.

## 2026-06-26

### Backend Review

**Request**
- Read the server/backend and summarize what features exist.

**Findings**
- Backend is an Express + TypeScript + Prisma/PostgreSQL API.
- Product is a multi-tenant PG/hostel management SaaS.
- Existing modules include auth, organizations, roles, rooms, floors, tenants, gate passes, visitors, dues, payments, complaints, announcements, mess, documents, staff contacts, notifications, parents, audit logs, metrics, platform admin, plans, organizations, and feature toggles.

### Frontend Page Planning

**Request**
- List all frontend pages needed according to backend.
- Then list them in simplest connected flow.

**Output**
- Defined role-based app areas for owner, warden, guard/security, tenant, parent, and platform admin.
- Main flow established:
  - Login -> Dashboard -> Module -> List page -> Detail/action page.

### Initial Frontend Prototype

**Request**
- Build UI using provided reference style, but not the content.
- Connect pages visually to backend routes and database intent.

**Changes**
- Created first clickable frontend prototype in `client/app/page.tsx`.
- Added styling in `client/app/globals.css`.
- Included module flow, page connections, API route mapping, and Prisma model mapping.

**Issue / Correction**
- User clarified this should not look like a dev planning app.
- Reworked frontend into a real product-style SaaS interface instead of visible backend route documentation.

### Product UI Shell

**Request**
- Make it look like a full deployed usable product.

**Changes**
- Replaced developer route-map UI with a production-style app shell.
- Added login panel, role switcher, dashboard metrics, module sidebar, lists, forms, workflows, and sync actions.
- Removed visible dev terms like "Server routes", "Prisma", and "Database query area".

**Verification**
- `client npm run build` passed.
- Browser verified dashboard and tenants page render.

### Environment Examples

**Request**
- Create env examples for both client and server.

**Changes**
- Added `client/.env.example` with:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api`
- Added `server/.env.example` with:
  - `NODE_ENV`
  - `PORT`
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `JWT_SECRET`
- Updated `client/.gitignore` to allow committing `.env.example`.

### Multi-Tenant Routing

**Request**
- App should not show dashboard before login.
- Customers should access their own app by workspace slug and role path, e.g. `/city-complex/owner`.
- Public landing page should help create workspace, generated emails, password, and role slugs.
- Platform panel should track subscriptions, cancellations, and updates.

**Decisions**
- Keep `/` as public landing/onboarding only.
- Use `/{workspaceSlug}/{role}` as private customer app route.
- Use `/platform/admin` conceptually for internal platform admin.
- Backend already has `Organization.slug`, which is the correct tenant anchor.

**Changes**
- Rebuilt `/` as public onboarding/landing page.
- Added dynamic route `client/app/[workspace]/[role]/page.tsx`.
- Added protected workspace UI in `client/app/components/workspace-app.tsx`.
- Before login, only role portal login is shown.
- After login, frontend checks backend login response for matching `orgSlug` and `role`.
- Mapped `/security` UI role to backend `guard` role.

**Verification**
- `client npm run build` passed.
- Verified `/` shows public onboarding only.
- Verified `/city-complex/owner` shows login gate only before auth.

### Demo Seed Setup

**Request**
- Create/update Prisma seed for appropriate demo testing.

**Changes**
- Expanded `server/prisma/seed.ts`.
- Seed now creates:
  - Plans
  - Platform admin
  - Demo organization `city-complex`
  - Demo users for owner, warden, security, staff, tenant, second tenant, and parent
  - User-role mappings
  - Org features
  - Floors and rooms
  - Tenant profiles

  - Visitor
  - Complaint and complaint update
  - Announcement
  - Mess menu and item
  - Document
  - Staff contacts

- Enforce subscription suspension across customer APIs.

## Implemented

- Added `account_slug` and `is_primary` membership fields with a deployed database migration.
- Added unified `POST /api/auth/resolve-login` for both property accounts and isolated platform accounts.

- Verified tenant auto-routing to `/city-complex/tenant/aarav-mehta` and platform auto-routing to `/1forge/platform` in the browser.
- Demo seed refresh was attempted but Neon became temporarily unreachable after migration; first login safely backfills missing account slugs.
# 2026-06-27 - Pre-push Protection, Testing, and Docker Setup

## Requested

- Add production-minded application protection and checks before repository pushes.
- Add quick Docker-based first-time setup for client, server, and PostgreSQL.
- Integrate automated validation, tests, CI, security scanning, and contributor tooling.

- Added root npm orchestration, Make targets, environment template, Docker ignore rules, and contributor documentation.
- Added development and production Docker stages for Next.js and Express plus Compose services for PostgreSQL, API, and client.
- Added automatic local migrations, opt-in seeding, persistent volumes, readiness-gated dependencies, and service health checks.
- Added strict Zod environment validation and removed insecure JWT fallbacks.
- Added Helmet, strict CORS, general/API login rate limits, Pino structured logs with secret redaction, and liveness/readiness endpoints.
- Disabled public signup routing because account issuance belongs to the 1Forge platform workflow.
- Added Zod validation for unified login and platform account issuance.
- Added HTTP-only refresh cookies, refresh-token rotation, and server-side logout invalidation.
- Added server ESLint, client lint baseline, typecheck scripts, Vitest, Supertest, Testing Library, and Playwright.
- Added API protection and database authorization tests, theme control tests, and desktop/mobile unified-login E2E tests.
- Added Husky, lint-staged, Commitlint, Prettier configuration, GitHub Actions with PostgreSQL, Docker build validation, CodeQL, Dependabot, and Playwright failure artifacts.
- Added starter OpenAPI documentation and production/development guidance.
- Fixed legacy lint findings and isolated test sources from clean production server builds.
- Added Next development-origin configuration required for deterministic Playwright hydration.
- Prevented platform users from calling organization notification APIs.

- Database-backed authorization suite passes all five tests.
- Playwright passes four tests across desktop Chromium and Pixel 7 profiles.
- Client and server staged-file lint commands pass from the repository root.
- Prisma schema validation passes.
- Root and server dependency audits report zero vulnerabilities.
- Client audit reports two moderate transitive PostCSS advisories; the automated force-fix incorrectly proposes Next 9 and was intentionally not applied.
- `docker compose config` passes.
- Docker image execution could not be tested locally because Docker Desktop is not running; CI builds both production images.

# 2026-06-27 - Make Workflow and Repository Hygiene

## Requested

- Briefly document what every Make command does and when contributors should use it.
- Fix the Docker build and migration errors found while exercising the Make workflow.
- Keep local secrets, generated output, test artifacts, and machine files out of GitHub.

## Implemented

- Added a self-documenting `make help` target and short comments above every Make target.
- Made `make setup` preserve an existing `.env` instead of overwriting local configuration.
- Made migration and seed commands work even when the API container is not already running.
- Moved the default host PostgreSQL binding to port `5433` to avoid common conflicts with a locally installed database.
- Made database reset restart the stack in the background.
- Synchronized the server lockfile so Docker's reproducible `npm ci` installation can complete.
- Added a non-secret build-time database placeholder required for offline Prisma client generation.
- Expanded root ignore rules for environment secrets, keys, dependencies, build output, test reports, logs, local databases, editor metadata, caches, and Docker overrides.
- Removed previously tracked macOS and Prisma validation artifacts.

## Verification

- `make help` lists every command with its intended use.
- `make build` successfully builds both server and client Docker images.
- `make migrate` starts PostgreSQL without a running API container and applies all five migrations.
- `make setup` starts healthy PostgreSQL, server, and client containers.
- Docker-hosted API health and frontend login endpoints both return HTTP 200.
- Ignore-rule samples and `git diff --check` pass.
