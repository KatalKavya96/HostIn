This file tracks what was requested, what decisions were made, what changed, and what was verified during the project. Keep appending new work here as the product evolves.

## 2026-06-26

### Backend Review

**Request**
- Read the server/backend and summarize what features exist.

**Findings**
- Backend is an Express + TypeScript + Prisma/PostgreSQL API.
- Product is a multi-tenant PG/hostel management SaaS.
- Existing modules include auth, organizations, roles, rooms, floors, tenants, gate passes, visitors, dues, payments, complaints, announcements, mess, documents, staff contacts, notifications, parents, audit logs, metrics, platform admin, plans, organizations, and feature toggles.

### Frontend Page Planning

**Request**
- List all frontend pages needed according to backend.
- Then list them in simplest connected flow.

**Output**
- Defined role-based app areas for owner, warden, guard/security, tenant, parent, and platform admin.
- Main flow established:
  - Login -> Dashboard -> Module -> List page -> Detail/action page.

### Initial Frontend Prototype

**Request**
- Build UI using provided reference style, but not the content.
- Connect pages visually to backend routes and database intent.

**Changes**
- Created first clickable frontend prototype in `client/app/page.tsx`.
- Added styling in `client/app/globals.css`.
- Included module flow, page connections, API route mapping, and Prisma model mapping.

**Issue / Correction**
- User clarified this should not look like a dev planning app.
- Reworked frontend into a real product-style SaaS interface instead of visible backend route documentation.

### Product UI Shell

**Request**
- Make it look like a full deployed usable product.

**Changes**
- Replaced developer route-map UI with a production-style app shell.
- Added login panel, role switcher, dashboard metrics, module sidebar, lists, forms, workflows, and sync actions.
- Removed visible dev terms like "Server routes", "Prisma", and "Database query area".

**Verification**
- `client npm run build` passed.
- Browser verified dashboard and tenants page render.

### Environment Examples

**Request**
- Create env examples for both client and server.

**Changes**
- Added `client/.env.example` with:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api`
- Added `server/.env.example` with:
  - `NODE_ENV`
  - `PORT`
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `JWT_SECRET`
- Updated `client/.gitignore` to allow committing `.env.example`.

### Multi-Tenant Routing

**Request**
- App should not show dashboard before login.
- Customers should access their own app by workspace slug and role path, e.g. `/city-complex/owner`.
- Public landing page should help create workspace, generated emails, password, and role slugs.
- Platform panel should track subscriptions, cancellations, and updates.

**Decisions**
- Keep `/` as public landing/onboarding only.
- Use `/{workspaceSlug}/{role}` as private customer app route.
- Use `/platform/admin` conceptually for internal platform admin.
- Backend already has `Organization.slug`, which is the correct tenant anchor.

**Changes**
- Rebuilt `/` as public onboarding/landing page.
- Added dynamic route `client/app/[workspace]/[role]/page.tsx`.
- Added protected workspace UI in `client/app/components/workspace-app.tsx`.
- Before login, only role portal login is shown.
- After login, frontend checks backend login response for matching `orgSlug` and `role`.
- Mapped `/security` UI role to backend `guard` role.

**Verification**
- `client npm run build` passed.
- Verified `/` shows public onboarding only.
- Verified `/city-complex/owner` shows login gate only before auth.

### Demo Seed Setup

- Create/update Prisma seed for appropriate demo testing.

**Changes**
- Expanded `server/prisma/seed.ts`.
- Seed now creates:

  - Platform admin
  - Demo organization `city-complex`
  - Demo users for owner, warden, security, staff, tenant, second tenant, and parent
  - User-role mappings
  - Org features
  - Floors and rooms
